3D Bar Chart
------------

A while back, I wrote a script to create bar charts (I had bigger goals, back
then). This is an updated version of that script using Python 3 and the
improved API that was introduced in Blender 2.5. I have tested this as ani
addon in Blender 2.6.3. 

### Example ###

![3D Bar Char][1]

This is just an example of using the script with the [output][2] from a
spreadsheet that did various permutations on a linear input.
FYI: I reduced the spacing between the bars to make it look solid.

The script is written as a complete Blender addon.
It can be installed from the File -> User Preferences -> Addons interface.
